# Monge-Ampère mesh movement in three dimensions
# ==============================================

# In this demo we demonstrate that the  Monge-Ampère mesh movement
# can also be applied to 3D meshes. We employ the `sinatan3` function
# from :cite:`park2019` to introduce an interesting pattern.

from firedrake import *

import movement


def sinatan3(mesh):
    x, y, z = SpatialCoordinate(mesh)
    return 0.1 * sin(50 * x * z) + atan2(0.1, sin(5 * y) - 2 * x * z)


# We will now try to use mesh movement to optimize the mesh such that it can
# most accurately represent this function with limited resolution.
# A good indicator for where resolution is required
# is to look at the curvature of the function which can be expressed
# in terms of the norm of the Hessian. A monitor function
# that targets high resolution in places of high curvature then looks like
#
# .. math::
#
#    m = 1 + \alpha \frac{H(u_h):H(u_h)}{\max_{{\bf x}\in\Omega} H(u_h):H(u_h)}
#
# where :math:`:` indicates the inner product, i.e. :math:`\sqrt{H:H}` is the Frobenius norm
# of :math:`H`. We have normalized such that the minimum of the monitor function is one (where
# the error is zero), and its maximum is :math:`1 + \alpha` (where the curvature is maximal). This
# means we can select the ratio between the largest and smallest cell volume  in the
# moved mesh as :math:`1+\alpha`.
#
# As in the `previous Monge-Ampère demo <./monge_ampere1.py.html>`__, we use the
# :class:`~.MongeAmpereMover` to perform the mesh movement based on this monitor. We need
# to provide the monitor as a callback function that takes the mesh as its
# input. During the iterations of the mesh movement process the monitor will then
# be re-evaluated in the (iteratively)
# moved mesh nodes so that, as we improve the mesh, we can also more accurately
# express the monitor function in the desired high-resolution areas.
# To track what happens during these iterations, we define a VTK file object
# that we will write to in every call when the monitor gets re-evaluated.

from firedrake.output import VTKFile

f = VTKFile("monitor.pvd")
alpha = Constant(10.0)


def monitor(mesh):
    V = FunctionSpace(mesh, "CG", 1)
    # interpolation of the function itself, for output purposes only:
    u = Function(V, name="sinatan3")
    u.interpolate(sinatan3(mesh))

    # NOTE: we are taking the Hessian of the _symbolic_ UFL expression
    # returned by sinatan3(mesh), *not* of the P1 interpolated version
    # stored in u. u is a piecewise linear approximation; Taking its gradient
    # once would result in a piecewise constant (cell-wise) gradient, and taking
    # the gradient of that again would simply be zero.
    hess = grad(grad(sinatan3(mesh)))

    hnorm = Function(V, name="hessian_norm")
    hnorm.interpolate(inner(hess, hess))
    hmax = hnorm.dat.data[:].max()
    f.write(u, hnorm)
    return 1.0 + alpha * hnorm / Constant(hmax)


# Let us try this on a fairly coarse unit cube mesh. Note that
# we use the `"relaxation"` method (see :cite:`McRae:2018`),
# which gives faster convergence for this case.

n = 20
mesh = UnitCubeMesh(n, n, n)
mover = movement.MongeAmpereMover(mesh, monitor, method="relaxation")
mover.move()

# The results will be written to the `monitor.pvd` file which represents
# a series of outputs storing the function and hessian norm evaluated
# on each of the iteratively moved meshes. This can be viewed, e.g., using
# `ParaView <https://www.paraview.org/>`_, to produce the following
# image:

#    :align: center
#
# In the `next demo <./monge_ampere_helmholtz.py.html>`__, we will demonstrate
# how to optimize the mesh for the discretisation of a PDE with the aim to
# minimize its discretisation error.
