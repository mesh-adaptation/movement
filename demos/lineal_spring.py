# Mesh movement using the lineal spring approach
# ==============================================
#
# In this demo, we demonstrate a basic example using the *lineal spring* method, as
# described in :cite:`Farhat:1998`. For simplicity of presentation, we consider the same
# example considered in the `Laplacian smoothing <laplacian_smoothing.py.html>`__ demo,
# where mesh movement is driven by a forcing on the top boundary of a square mesh.
#
# The idea of the lineal spring method is to re-interpret the edges of a mesh as a
# structure of stiff beams. Each beam has a stiffness associated with it, which is
# related to its length and its orientation. We can assemble this information as a
# *stiffness matrix*,
#
# .. math::
#     \underline{\mathbf{K}} = \begin{bmatrix}
#     \underline{\mathbf{K}_{11}} && \dots && \underline{\mathbf{K}_{1N}}\\
#     \vdots && \ddots && \vdots\\
#     \underline{\mathbf{K}_{N1}} && \dots && \underline{\mathbf{K}_{NN}}\\
#     \end{bmatrix},
#
# where :math:`N` is the number of vertices in the mesh and each block
# :math:`\underline{\mathbf{K}_{ij}}` is a zero matrix if and only if vertex :math:`i`
# is *not* connected to vertex :math:`j`. For a 2D problem, each
# :math:`\underline{\mathbf{K}_{ij}}\in\mathbb{R}^{2\times2}` and
# :math:`\underline{\mathbf{K}}\in\mathbb{R}^{2N\times2N}`.
#
# As with the Laplacian smoothing method, the lineal spring approach relies on there
# being a user-specified forcing function. This acts on the vertices according to a
# forcing matrix,
#
# .. math::
#     \underline{\mathbf{f}} = \begin{bmatrix}
#         \mathbf{f}_1\\
#         \vdots\\
#         \mathbf{f}_N\\
#     \end{bmatrix}
#     \in\mathbb{R}^{N\times2}.
#
# That is, vertex :math:`i` is forced according to a vector :math:`\mathbf{f}_i`. Then
# we are able to compute the displacement of the vertices by solving the linear system
#
# .. math::
#     \underline{\mathbf{K}} \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{f},
#
# where :math:`\mathbf{u}\in\mathbb{R}^{2N}` and :math:`\mathbf{f}\in\mathbb{R}^{2N}`
# are 'flattened' versions of the displacement and forcing vectors. By solving this
# equation, we see how the structure of beams responds to the forcing.
#
# The main difference to note with the Laplacian smoothing approach is the following.
# The Laplacian smoothing method is formulated in terms of a mesh velocity
# :math:`\mathbf{v}`, which at timestep :math:`n` can be approximated as
#
# .. math::
#     \mathbf{v}_n \approx \frac{\mathbf{x}_n - \mathbf{x}_{n-1}}{\Delta t},
#
# where :math:`\mathbf{x}_n` are the mesh coordinates at timestep :math:`n` and
# :math:`\Delta t` is the timestep length. In the lineal spring method, however, we
# solve for the *overall* displacement, which at timestep :math:`n` takes the form
#
# .. math::
#     \mathbf{u}_n = \mathbf{x}_n - \mathbf{x}_0.
#
# So the former is related to recent changes in position, whereas the latter is
# concerned with changes in position *since the start of the simulation*.
#

# Recall the initial uniform mesh of the unit square used in the Laplacian smoothing
# demo, which has four boundary segments tagged with the integers 1, 2, 3, and 4. Note
# that segment 4 corresponds to the top boundary. ::

#
# We consider the same time-dependent forcing to the top boundary and see how the mesh
# structure responds. Recall the formula
#
# .. math::
#     \mathbf{f}(x,y,t)=\left[0, A\:\sin\left(\frac{2\pi t}T\right)\:\sin(\pi x)\right],
#
# where :math:`A` is the amplitude and :math:`T` is the time period. However, we cannot
# simply apply this formula in the same way as when solving the Poisson equation. We
# first need to apply a transformation to account for the fact that we are considering
# a discrete Poisson formulation. This amounts to applying the scale factor
#
# .. math::
#    K = \Delta x^2 / 4,
#
# where :math:`\Delta x` is the local mesh size. To account for this, we need to provide
# an additional index argument to :func:`forcing`. ::
