# Mesh movement using the lineal spring approach
# ==============================================
#
# In this demo, we demonstrate a basic example using the *lineal spring* method, as
# described in :cite:`Farhat:1998`. For simplicity of presentation, we consider a very
# similar example to that considered in the
# `Laplacian smoothing <laplacian_smoothing.py.html>`__ demo, where mesh movement is
# driven by enforcing a particular displacement of the top boundary of a square mesh.
#
# The idea of the lineal spring method is to re-interpret the edges of a mesh as a
# structure of stiff beams. Each beam has a stiffness associated with it, which is
# related to its length and its orientation. We can assemble this information as a
# *stiffness matrix*,
#
# .. math::
#     \underline{\mathbf{K}} = \begin{bmatrix}
#     \underline{\mathbf{K}_{11}} && \dots && \underline{\mathbf{K}_{1N}}\\
#     \vdots && \ddots && \vdots\\
#     \underline{\mathbf{K}_{N1}} && \dots && \underline{\mathbf{K}_{NN}}\\
#     \end{bmatrix},
#
# where :math:`N` is the number of vertices in the mesh and each block
# :math:`\underline{\mathbf{K}_{ij}}` is a zero matrix if and only if vertex :math:`i`
# is *not* connected to vertex :math:`j`. For a 2D problem, each
# :math:`\underline{\mathbf{K}_{ij}}\in\mathbb{R}^{2\times2}` and
# :math:`\underline{\mathbf{K}}\in\mathbb{R}^{2N\times2N}`.
#
# As with the Laplacian smoothing method, the lineal spring approach relies on there
# being a user-specified boundary condition, but note that it is now expressed as a
# boundary *displacement*, rather than a boundary velocity. Then we are able to compute
# the displacement of the vertices by solving the linear system
#
# .. math::
#     \underline{\mathbf{K}} \mathbf{u} = \boldsymbol{0},
#
# where :math:`\mathbf{u}\in\mathbb{R}^{2N}` is a 'flattened' version of the displacement
# vector. By solving this equation, we see how the structure of beams responds to the
# forced boundary displacement.
#
# There are two main differences to note with the Laplacian smoothing approach. The first
# is that Laplacian smoothing is formulated in terms of *mesh velocity*, whereas this
# method is formulated in terms of displacements. Secondly, the mesh velocity
# :math:`\mathbf{v}` in the Laplacian smoothing method may be approximated at timestep
# :math:`n` as
#
# .. math::
#     \mathbf{v}_n \approx \frac{\mathbf{x}_n - \mathbf{x}_{n-1}}{\Delta t},
#
# where :math:`\mathbf{x}_n` are the mesh coordinates at timestep :math:`n` and
# :math:`\Delta t` is the timestep length. In the lineal spring method, however, we
# solve for the *overall* displacement, which at timestep :math:`n` takes the form
#
# .. math::
#     \mathbf{u}_n = \mathbf{x}_n - \mathbf{x}_0.
#
# So Laplacian smoothing is related to *recent* changes in **velocity**, whereas the
# lineal spring method considered here is concerned with changes in **position** *since
# the start of the simulation*.

# Recall the initial uniform mesh of the unit square used in the Laplacian smoothing
# demo, which has four boundary segments tagged with the integers 1, 2, 3, and 4. Note
# that segment 4 corresponds to the top boundary. ::

#
# We consider the same time-dependent forcing to the top boundary and see how the mesh
# structure responds. We use a very similar formula,
#
# .. math::
#     \mathbf{u}_f(x,y,t)=\left[0, A\:\sin\left(\frac{2\pi t}T\right)\:\sin(\pi x)\right],
#
# where :math:`A` is the amplitude and :math:`T` is the time period, but again note that
# it is now expressed as a boundary *displacement* :math:`\mathbf{u}_f`:, rather than a
# boundary velocity. As such, we should not expect the boundary movement to be the same.
