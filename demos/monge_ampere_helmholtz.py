# Using mesh movement to optimise the mesh for PDE solution
# =========================================================
#
# In this demo we will demonstrate how we might use mesh movement to obtain a mesh
# that is optimised for solving a particular PDE. The general idea is that we
# want to reduce numerical error by increasing resolution where the local error
# is (expected to be) high and decrease it elsewhere.
#
# As an example we will look at the discretisation of the Helmholtz equation
#
# .. math::
#
#    -\nabla^2 u + u &= f
#
#    \nabla u \cdot \vec{n} &= 0 \quad \textrm{on}\ \Gamma
#
# For an explanation of how we can use Firedrake to implement a Finite Element
# Method (FEM) discretisation of this PDE see the `corresponding Firedrake demo
# <https://www.firedrakeproject.org/demos/helmholtz.py.html>`_. The only
# changes we introduce is that we choose a different, slightly more interesting
# solution :math:`u` and rhs :math:`f`
#
# .. math::
#
#    u(x, y) &= \exp\left(-\frac{(x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2}{w^2}\right)
#
#    f(x, y) &= -\nabla^2 u(x, y) + u(x, y)
#        = \left[ -\frac{4(x-x_0)^2 + 4(y-y_0)^2}{w^4}
#                + \frac{4}{w^2} + 1 \right]
#          \exp\left(-\frac{(x-x_0)^2 +  (y-y_0)^2}{w^2}\right),
#
# where :math:`(x_0, y_0)` is the centre of the Gaussian with width :math:`w`.
# Note that here we *first* choose the solution :math:`u` after which we can
# compute what rhs :math:`f` should be, by substitution in the PDE, in order
# for :math:`u` to be the analytical solution. This so-called Method of
# Manufactured Solutions approach is an easy way to construct PDE
# configurations for which we know the analytical solution, e.g. for testing
# purposes.
#
# Based on the code in the Firedrake demo, we first solve the PDE on a uniform mesh.
# Because our chosen solution does not satisfy homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions,
# we instead apply Dirichlet boundary conditions based on the chosen analytical
# solution.

#
# Of course, in many practical problems we do not actually have access
# to the exact solution. We can then use the Hessian of the numerical
# solution in the monitor function. When calculating the Hessian we have to
# be a bit careful however: since our numerical FEM solution :math:`u_h`
# is a piecewise linear function, its first gradient results in a
# piecewise *constant* function, a vector-valued constant
# function in each cell. Taking its gradient in each cell would therefore
# simply be zero. Instead, we should numerically approximate the derivatives
# to "recover" the Hessian, for which there are a number of different methods.
#
# As Hessians are often used in metric-based h-adaptivity, some of these
# methods have been implemented in the :py:mod:`animate` package.
# An implementation of a monitor based on the Hessian of the numerical
# solution is given below. Note that this requires solving the Helmholtz
# PDE in every mesh movement iteration, and thus may become significantly
# slower for large problems.

# Even though the number of iterations has increased (24 compared to 17 and 19),
# each iteration is slightly cheaper since the PDE is not solved again every time.
# Despite that, the increased total number of iterations lead to a slightly longer total
# runtime. Depending on the PDE in question and the solver used to solve it,
# interpolating the solution may turn out to be slower than recomputing it.
# We also observe that interpolating the solution lead to a significantly larger error.
# In conclusion, in this particular example interpolating the solution field did not
# lead to neither a lower error nor a faster mesh movement step compared to previous
# approaches. Let us explore one more approach.
#
# We may further speed up the mesh movement step by also avoiding recomputing
# the Hessian at every iteration, which, in this particular example, is the most
# expensive part of the monitor function. Similarly to the above example, we compute the
# solution on the initial (uniform) mesh, but now we also compute its Hessian and
# interpolate the Hessian onto adapted meshes.

#
# In this demo we demonstrated several examples of monitor functions and briefly
# evaluated their performance. Each approach has inherent advantages and limitations
# which should be considered for every new problem of interest. PDEs that are highly
# sensitive to changes in local resolution may require recomputing the solution at
# every iteration. In other cases we may obtain adequate results by defining a monitor
# function that computes the solution less frequently, or even only once per iteration.
# Movement allows and encourages such experimentation with different monitor functions.
