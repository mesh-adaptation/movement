# Mesh Movement in a time-dependent problem
# =========================================
#
# In the `previous demo <./monge_ampere_helmholtz.py.html>`__, we demonstrated mesh
# movement with the Monge-Amp√®re method in the context of a steady-state PDE. In this
# demo, we progress to the time-dependent case.
#
# The demo solves an advection equation,
#
# ..math::
#    \frac{\partial c}{\partial t}+\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla c=0,
#
# where the solution field :math:`c` is approximated in :math:`\mathbb{P}1` space, and
# the background velocity field is denoted by :math:`\mathbf{u}`. The velocity field is
# approximated in vector :math:`\mathbb{P}1` space.
#
# As in previous examples, import from Firedrake and the :class:`~.MongeAmpereMover`. In
# this demo, we also import :class:`~.RiemannianMetric` from the Animate metric-based
# mesh adaptation package, as it comes with the functionality to recover Hessians. ::
