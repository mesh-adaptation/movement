Movement is a mesh adaptation toolkit enabling users to spatially redistribute mesh degrees of freedom using a variety of different methods from the literature, as well as tools for detecting mesh tangling.

Movement is built for use with the [Firedrake finite element library](https://firedrakeproject.org/).

## Installation

To install Firedrake, follow the instructions on the Firedrake [download webpage](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/download.html). This will create a Python virtual environment, which Firedrake is installed into.

Activate the virtual environment and then execute the following commands:
```
cd ${VIRTUAL_ENV}/src
git clone https://github.com/mesh-adaptation/movement.git
cd movement
make install
```

The above assumes that you wish to clone the repo using the web URL. If you would prefer to clone using a password-protected SSH key then instead execute
```
cd ${VIRTUAL_ENV}/src
git clone git@github.com:mesh-adaptation/movement.git
cd movement
make install
```
